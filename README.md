- Introduction
A dashboard practice using tools including BigQuery and Tableau to manipulate data and create data visualization. The last time the data was updated 4/29/2022. 

- Data source
All the data I chose is produced by Our World in Data, a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems. The COVID-19 database was used by the United Nations, the White House, and the World Health Organization. That is to say, it is one of the most credible database that record the information about COVID-19 around the world.
